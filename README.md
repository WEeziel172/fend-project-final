# FEND Neighbourhood map

This is my take on the fend React project 'Neighbourhood map'

## Overview
This application enables you to search restaurants from London
You will be shown a default list of selected restaraunts in london.

## Usage
Download or clone this repo to your desired directory. Navigate to the said directory with your IDE, and run 'npm install', which will make sure you will get all dependencies which the app requires.

Then, use 'npm start' to run the application locally.

You will be shown a map of London with a selection of different restaurants. Clickin on a marker on the map will reveal the ratings and a review of the said restaurant. Clicking on the items list on left will narrow down the displayed markers on the map to the selected one.

#npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
